# dowload-googletrends
A simple R script to scrape daily search data from Google Trends. Google Trends does not provide daily data over a span of 90 days, so this script implements a simple way to sequentially obtain daily data and normalize it with monthly data from Google Trends(if the period is over 90 days).

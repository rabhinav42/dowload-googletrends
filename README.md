# dowload-googletrends
A simple R script to scrape daily search data from Google Trends. Google Trends does not provide daily data over a span of 90 days, so this script implements a simple way to sequentially obtain daily data and normalize it with monthly data from Google Trends(if the period is over 90 days). The code specifically normalizes hit data, the same tactic may be used to normalize any other numeric data obtained as well.
